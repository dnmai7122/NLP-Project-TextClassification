# NLP\_Project\_TextClassification

## Overview

This project explores **Vietnamese text classification** using modern NLP techniques.
It includes preprocessing, dataset preparation, and fine-tuning transformer-based models (e.g., PhoBERT, BARTpho) for classification tasks such as **sentiment analysis** and **topic categorization**.

The work is part of the course **SUDO CODE – Week 3: Basic ML Techniques for NLP**.

## Dataset

I use the **Vietnamese Text Classification Dataset** by [Nguyen Van Anh Tuan (2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tuannguyenvananh/vietnamese-text-classification-dataset).

* 10,000+ Vietnamese news samples
* 7 categories: Thể thao (Sports), Chính trị (Politics), Đời sống (Life), Kinh doanh (Business), Pháp luật (Law), Công nghệ (Technology), Giáo dục (Education)

### How to download:

1. Log into Kaggle and accept the dataset terms.
2. Download and place it under `data/` in your repo.
3. Or load directly in Kaggle notebook with:

   ```python
   !kaggle datasets download -d tuannguyenvananh/vietnamese-text-classification-dataset
   ```

---

## Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NLP_Project_TextClassification.git
cd NLP_Project_TextClassification
pip install --upgrade transformers datasets torch scikit-learn
```

---

## Usage

### Run in Kaggle

Simply open `250114-nlp-project-textclassification.ipynb` in Kaggle → attach the dataset → run all cells.

### Run locally

1. Ensure dataset is under `data/`.
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 250114-nlp-project-textclassification.ipynb
   ```
3. Train and evaluate the model inside the notebook.
